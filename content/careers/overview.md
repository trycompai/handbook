## Working with us

Being open and transparent is one of our core values - and in the name of transparency, we'll be real with you: working for a us means you should be prepared to put in more than you would at a normal job. In return, we'll make sure you're compensated with:

1. Free Food (Uber Eats 2x a day)
2. Free Transportation (subway/uber etc)
3. Great stories to tell your future grandkids (we went to Vegas + Atlantic City recently)

## Expectations

You should be comfortable with the fact that we typically work six days a week, with a hard requirement of being in-person Monday-Friday from either our New York City (US) or Southampton (UK) office. Feel free to work remotely on Saturday if you need to.

### You'll be a good fit if you are:

* One of the best [insert your role] in the world
* Like working 10 hours/day minimum
* Strive for greatness in everything you do
* Have a high attention to detail
