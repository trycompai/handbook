## Trial Period

At [Comp AI](https://trycomp.ai), we take a different approach to hiring. All of our full time employees take part in a 4-week work trial with us, and then at the end of the contract a decision will be made on whether we continue working together.

If we extend a trial, we do it because we believe you have what it takes to be part of the Comp AI team. This is the last step to show both sides what it's like working with each other - it's your chance to work with us without committing immediately.

You should take this time to figure out if you like:

* The company and our mission
* Working in a fast-moving startup environment
* Being in-person with us
* Working with the founding team
* Your team mates

For us, it's a chance to get to know you and how you work, before extending a full time contract.

For both sides, it's absolutely fine to part ways at any time during this trial period with no hard feelings.
