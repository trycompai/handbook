## Mission

> To help 100,000 companies get compliant with cyber security frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001 and HIPAA by 2032.

To simply put it, compliance enables companies to build trust with others by taking steps to protect their data. We're making it easier for companies to build that trust by creating the core infrastructure that makes becoming compliant straightforward and affordable for every company.

## Vision

> Changing the way companies approach compliance.

Compliance is easier to achieve when you consider it from the very start. We see a world where Comp AI becomes a natural part of every startups tech stack.
